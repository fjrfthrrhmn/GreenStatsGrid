# ðŸŒ± GreenStatsGrid

This repository is a personal automation project to keep my GitHub contribution graph active and consistent.

## ðŸ¤– What It Does

- Automatically commits 3â€“4 times per day at random times
- Uses GitHub Actions to run a Node.js script that generates lightweight dummy changes
- All commits are valid and made to this public repo, so they show up in my contribution graph
